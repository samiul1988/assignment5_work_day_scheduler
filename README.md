## My Actions and Notes

* Obtained base file from Assignment Description Page (link).
* To be addedd
* Basic considerations were as follows:
    * I used one html page for all the views, and used javascript to selectively display or hide appropriate views when different buttons are clicked.
    * When the user clicks "Start Quiz" button, a timer gets started and questions are displayed in sequence.
    * A message is shown at the bottom of the quiz panel showing "Correct!" or "Wrong!" after an answer option is clicked.
    * At any point, if the "View high scores" button is clicked, then the high score table is displayed and the quiz gets reset.
